# Review and manage your Azure Devops pull requests directly in VS Code

> This extension is in early stages of development. It currently works only in VSCode Insider.

This extension is inspired and based on [Github Pull Request Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github). The extension only works with *git* based repository. *TFVC* is not supported. Currently the extension supports following feature -

- Authenticating and connecting VS Code to Azure Devops.
- Listing and browsing PRs from within VS Code.
- Reviewing PRs from within VS Code with in-editor commenting.
- Validating PRs from within VS Code with easy checkouts.

You can read more about the basic features in my [blog](https://ankitbko.github.io/blog/2021/01/azdo-pr-vscode-extension/).


> **Note From Author**: I created this extension during last 2 weeks of December 2020 as a fun side project. Having never created a VS Code Extension before this was quite a journey. I am currently planning to get this to somewhat stable state before adding more features to it. Please try this extension and report any bugs by raising issue. Since this is a fork of Github PR Extension I will try to backport important updates from upstream to this extension. If you feel there has been an important bug fix or feature update in upstream that you would like in this extension, please raise an Issue here with link to the PR or Issue in upstream.

> **Disclaimer**: Although I work at Microsoft and this is a fork of Github PR Extension, this extension is not an official release or supported by Microsoft. This is a side project that I will try to maintain in my free time. Any help is always appreciated.

## Getting Started
It's easy to get started with Azure Devops Pull Requests for Visual Studio Code. Simply follow these steps to get started.

1. Make sure you have VSCode version 1.52.0 or higher.
1. Reload VS Code after the installation (click the reload button next to the extension).
1. Open your desired Azure Devops repository.
1. You will need to configure the `azdoPullRequests.projectName` and `azdoPullRequests.orgUrl` setting. You can configure it in workspace settings and commit it so others in your team wouldn't need to do this configuration again. (Look at the next section to understand the format of these settings).
1. You will need to configure [PAT token in Azure Devops](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page) to login. Click on *show all scopes* and select the following scopes for the token - `Code: Read & Write`, `Pull Request Threads: Read & Write`.
1. A new tab would have appeared on the activity bar on the left. Open it and click on `Sign in` button. Enter the PAT token and press enter.
1. You should be good to go!
